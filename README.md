# **Optimization of AI Navigation**

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on optimizing the pathfinding for trucks using AI-based search algorithms. The goal is to improve the efficiency of truck navigation by leveraging multiple algorithms, including **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **A* Search**, **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**, and **Greedy Search**. The optimization process is enhanced with a feedback system powered by a companion app, which acts as a judge to evaluate the paths and suggest adjustments to improve results.

## **Features**

- **AI Search Algorithms**:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes level by level.
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as deep as possible before backtracking.
  - **A* Search**: Uses heuristics to find the optimal path.
  - **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**: Expands the least cost node.
  - **Greedy Search**: Focuses on nodes that appear to be closer to the goal.

- **Truck Path Optimization**: The system identifies the most efficient routes for trucks based on various factors such as distance, time, and obstacles.

- **App Integration**: An app is used to monitor and evaluate the truck's path. It provides feedback on the navigation process and can suggest adjustments, such as rearranging checkpoints or optimizing route choices, based on dynamic factors.

## **How it Works**

1. **Pathfinding Algorithms**: The truck’s route is determined by one of the AI search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*, UCS, or Greedy Search). Each algorithm explores possible routes and selects the most optimal one based on specific criteria such as distance, obstacles, or travel time.

2. **App Feedback Mechanism**:
   - The app acts as a "judge" in the optimization process. It receives the truck’s proposed path and evaluates its efficiency.
   - The app provides feedback on potential issues such as unnecessary detours, traffic conditions, or suboptimal routes.
   - Based on the feedback, the app can suggest adjustments, such as reordering delivery points or selecting a different algorithm for a more optimal result.

3. **Dynamic Path Adjustments**: As new data is received (e.g., road conditions, fuel consumption, etc.), the app may recommend modifications to the truck's current path, which could impact the optimization results. This iterative feedback loop helps refine the navigation process for better overall efficiency.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Search Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, A*, UCS, and Greedy Search implemented in Python.
- **App Development**: Mobile app developed using [insert technology, e.g., Flutter, React Native, etc.] for real-time path feedback and optimization suggestions.
- **Data Handling**: Utilizes real-time data for traffic, road conditions, and truck performance to adjust routes dynamically.

### **Where to Host Your Images**

1. **Imgur**: You can use platforms like Imgur to upload images and then link to them directly, as I've done above.
2. **GitHub**: GitHub can host your images directly in your repository if you prefer to keep everything in one place.
3. **Other Public Image Hosts**: You can also upload images to other platforms like **Dropbox**, **Google Drive**, or **Flickr** and get shareable links.
